# Web-based Code Complexity measuring tool
## Module - Information Technology Project Management
Function - Measuring the complexity of a program statement due to inheritance.

The inheritance complexity of the program statement belongs to class is same as the weight assigned for that class due to its inheritance pattern. Depending on the inheritance pattern, each inheritance class is assigned weight as 1, 2, 3 or 4.
- 3 rd year 1 sememster project.
- This is a web application. 
- Integrated development environment (IDE) - Eclipse
- Implemented to  measuring the complexity of a program statement due to inheritance.
  - Total inheritances (Ti) = No of direct inheritances (Ndi) + No of indirect inheritances (Nidi)
  - If Ti value is less than or equal to three, then Ci = Ti. However, if the Ti value is greater than three, then Ci = 4
- **Functions** 
  - can measure complexity in language Java
  - can Uplaod java, cpp, txt files
  - Display the table of calculated results for Ti, Ndi, Nidi
  - can edit weight and display the table of calculated result.
- **Followed Agile methodology - SCRUM**
  - Product Backlog
  - Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 Backlog 
  - Planning Poker
  - Daily scrum
  - Sprint Review
- **Testing - Selenium IDE**

  - Selenium is a free automated testing tool for Web Applications.
  - Allows for developing functional tests in the browser.
  - It allows to record the workflows, so that can prevent future regressions of code.
  - It works on any browser that supports JavaScript.
  - Supports for cross-browser testing. 
  - Supports several languages including Java, C#, PHP, and Python.
  - Provides an efficient way of comparing expected and actual results.
  - Inbuilt reporting mechanism.
